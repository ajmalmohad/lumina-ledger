- Lagging transactions more than the required timelimit will reduce the difficulty and on API call if we seperate calls over a long period, the difficulty reaches zero (but is kept back to 3 by default case), but the number of preceding zeros will be 0, which will cause incosistency and failure to validate the chain
- It will mine a block from empty pool of transactions
- Blockchain wallet is really insecure and is inconsistent
